= Asciidoctorj Quarkus Server

This project is a test to validate how to integrate Asciidoctorj into a Quarkus application.

NOTE: Here's a similar project for SpringBoot https://github.com/abelsromero/asciidoctorj-springboot-server.

== Special requirements

In *Java mode* there's no special needs to package and run it.
Simply because Quarkus foes not creates uber jars, or use special classloaders.

*Native mode* is not supported given JRuby internal reflection usage (see https://github.com/jruby/jruby/issues/5665).

NOTE: To reproduce the errors seen, the porject includes the configuration to add a replicated Asciidoctorj service provider and a manual instantiation of JRubyAsciidoctor to ensure it's compilation.

== Testing

. Build and run the app with.

 ./mvn clean package && java -jar target/asciidoctorj-quarkus-server-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar
